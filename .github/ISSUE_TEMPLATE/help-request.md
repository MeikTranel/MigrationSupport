**Project:**
URL: Preferably a git project URL. SVN is also accepted.
Synopsis: Concise description of project.

**What am i looking for?**
A description of what you want to happen. I don't require you to know what you want right away. "Make the development experience a little nicer" is a valid entry in my books.

**What problems stopped me from doing this myself before? (OPTIONAL)**
This can include past experiences, fears and/or roadblocks.

**Special Requirements**
Describe special requirements relating to MSBuild, .NET or other topics. (An example would be if you are forced to use a specific Visual Studio version or your CICD infrastructure does not support X...)
